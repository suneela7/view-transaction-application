# Sample Page with Transaction Summary


### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


The following docs describe how you can test and develop this application further.

### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application 
  running.
- Hit http://localhost:8000/index.html#/transactions in browser after server starts.
